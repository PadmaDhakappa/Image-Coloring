**Abstract:**
This project focuses on the development of an image coloring system tailored to the needs of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Leveraging machine learning techniques, including autoencoders, standard GANs, and U-Net architecture, the system aims to colorize monochromatic images in a manner that is engaging and beneficial for children with ASD and ADHD. By generating realistic and high-resolution colored images, the project seeks to enhance the educational experience and attention span of children with neurodevelopmental disorders.

**Inspiration:**
The inspiration for this project arises from the growing recognition of the impact of visual stimuli on individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly ASD and ADHD. Research studies, such as "The Effect of Colored Images on Children with Autism" and "Do Colored Images Influence Attention Span in Children with ADHD," have highlighted the potential benefits of colored images in improving attention and engagement in these populations. Drawing from these findings, this project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to create colored images tailored to the specific needs of children with ASD and ADHD.

**Introduction:**
The introduction provides an overview of the project's objectives and methodologies. It discusses the challenges faced by children with ASD and ADHD in processing monochromatic images and the potential benefits of colored images in enhancing their attention and engagement. Additionally, the introduction outlines the three main approaches used in the image coloring system: autoencoder, standard GAN, and U-Net architecture. It sets the stage for the subsequent sections, which delve into each approach in detail.

**Methodology:**
The methodology section details the approach taken to develop the image coloring system using autoencoder, standard GAN, and U-Net architecture. It begins with data collection, including obtaining monochromatic images from landscape datasets and Coco dataset. The next step involves data preprocessing, including resizing and normalization of the images. Subsequently, the methodology describes the implementation of each approach, including the algorithms used and the evaluation metrics employed to assess their performance. Specifically, the system aims to generate colored images that are realistic and engaging for children with ASD while also catering to the high-resolution requirements of children with ADHD.

**Discussion:**
The discussion section examines the findings and insights derived from implementing each approach in the image coloring system. It analyzes the effectiveness of autoencoder, standard GAN, and U-Net architecture in generating colored images suitable for children with ASD and ADHD. Additionally, it discusses the strengths and limitations of each method and proposes potential enhancements for future iterations of the system. Furthermore, the discussion explores the implications of the project's findings for educators and caregivers working with children with neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting the potential benefits of using colored images in educational settings.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, the project underscores the importance of personalized visual stimuli in supporting the learning and attention span of children with ASD and ADHD. It emphasizes the versatility of different machine learning approaches, including autoencoder, standard GAN, and U-Net architecture, in generating colored images tailored to the specific needs of these populations. The project concludes by highlighting the potential impact of the image coloring system in educational settings, where it can serve as a valuable tool for creating engaging and beneficial visual content for children with neurodevelopmental disorders.
