# Image-Coloring

Children with Autism and ADHD are unable to handle monochromatic images. Children with Autism need the image to look realistic with not so high resolution and to hold the attention of children with ADHD the image needs to be very high resolution. This usecase is particularly useful in educational setup.

Papers Refered:
The Effect of Coloured Images on Children with Autism 
Do colour images influence Attention span in children with ADHD  

Here we have tried with 3 different ways:
1. using Autoencoder (Landscape Dataset)
2. using standard GAN (Landscape Dataset)
3. using U Net architecture (Coco Dataset)

Conclusion:
Images generated by Autoencoders good for learners with Autism
Images generated by standard GAN ideal for regular learners
Images generated by UNet architecture,PatchGAN has high resolution and is good for children with ADHD.
